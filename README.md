NLP sentiment analysis

In this simple project I have created a sentiment analysis model with an accuracy of 93%. It uses libraries like NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, wordcloud to make data processing and analysing easier. 

This project uses an compilation of reviews on "Amazon echo" that is already available on Kaggle website
